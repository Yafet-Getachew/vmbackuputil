To add your virtual machine to the list of machines to be backed up to MEDEMER 

- open the backup-vms.sh shellscript
- append the following three lines to the three variables (virtualmachine, users, passwords)

		
	virtualmachines=(
		[your vm name]="your vm IP"
		)

	users=(
		[your vm name]="your vm user name"
		)

	passwords=(
		[your vm name]="your vm password"
		)

the vm name you use must be the one registered in the virtual box, to see a list of registered
vms in virtualbox use

	VBoxManage list vms

and the names should be in quotes like so "imagename"
