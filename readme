Before you do anything with the shellscript you should create an RSA key with 

```shell
	ssh-keygen
```

then you should copy your public key to medemer with 

```shell
	ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub medemer@172.16.10.8

	ssh-add
```

make sure you have passwordless ssh access with 

```console
	ssh medemer@172.16.10.8
```



To add your virtual machine to the list of machines to be backed up to MEDEMER 

- open the backup-vms.sh shellscript
- append the following three lines to the three variables (virtualmachine, users, passwords)

	```shell	
	virtualmachines=(
		[your vm name]="your vm IP"
		)

	users=(
		[your vm name]="your vm user name"
		)

	passwords=(
		[your vm name]="your vm password"
		)
	```

the vm name you use must be the one registered in the virtual box, to see a list of registered
vms in virtualbox use

	```shell
		VBoxManage list vms
	```
and the names should be in quotes like so "imagename"
